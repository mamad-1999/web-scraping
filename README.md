# Medium Premium Checker

This is a Go-based tool that checks whether a given Medium article URL is a premium (member-only) story. It uses the `chromedp` package to automate a headless Chrome browser, navigate to the provided URL, and determine if the article is premium by checking for specific indicators such as "Member-only story" text or a golden star icon.

## Installation
